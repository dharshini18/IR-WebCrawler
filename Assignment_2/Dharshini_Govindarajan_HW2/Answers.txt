Task1 - Brief Report

BFS - crawl
------------

Number of Pages with no in-links (Sources) - 0
Number of pages with no out-links (Sinks) - 6

DFS - crawl
------------

Number of Pages with no in-links (Sources) - 0
Number of pages with no out-links (Sinks) - 0

The BFS crawl consits of the crawled URL- article ID as the first entry and the entries following are the inlinks to that particular node seperated by spaces.

The DFS crawl consits of the crawled URL- article ID as the first entry and the entries following are the inlinks to that particular node seperated by spaces.

The number of sources for both the graphs G1 and G2 i.e the BFS and DFS crawling respectively is zero. The reason being, we are building a graph using the links crawled and the links
that point to the links being crawled. So there is no possiblity for a link to be a part of the graph if it does not consist of any in-links.


The number of sink nodes, i.e nodes without out-links for G1 and G2 i.e BFS and DFS crawling respectively is 6 and 0. The sink nodes in the BFS crawl are relatively higher when compared to the
DFS crawl. This could be because, the BFS technique crawls links at the same depth, so the possiblity of a link being an in-link for one of the crawled links is a little less when compared to the
DFS crawl. Whereas in DFS, the links at adjacent depths could be closely realted to each other since they orginate from the same node/depth.

Task 2C - Question1
--------------------

Comparision of resulting pagerank using a damping factor of d = 0.55 to the baseline

Baseline - Baseline.txt

BFS_File = PageRankG1_D2.txt
DFS_File = PageRankG2_D2.txt

Comparision of Baseline and BFS_File
1) Obeserving the DocID and score in this scenario, it is evident that the scores in baseline file are higher
   than the scores in the BFS_File
2) Also, the links in the BFS_File are not consistent with the Baseline
3) Teleportation or the order in which the links of the BFS_File are visited are different when compared to the
   Baseline file
4) Documents are visited in an order that seems fit with the damping factor. The factor is included
   to avoid sinks. The chance of being on a certain page changes as the damping factor is changed
   
Comparision of Baseline and DFS_File
1) The DFS_file is extremely different when compared to the Baseline file
2) The crawling techniques are different, hence the order in which the graph is constructed or the order in which
   the links appear differs
3) The links that are common between the baseline and the DFS_Fil, have scores where the DFS_File has higher score
   than the baseline
4) Documents are visited in an order that seems fit with the damping factor. The factor is included
   to avoid sinks. The chance of being on a certain page changes as the damping factor is changed
5) At least on some graphs, arbitrarily small variations in the damping factor can completely reverse the ranking of the top k nodes

Task 2C - Question2
--------------------

Baseline - Baseline.txt

BFS_File - PageRank2B_G1.txt
DFS_File - PageRank2B_G2.txt

Comparision of Baseline and BFS_File
1) Observing the two files, it is evident that the links that are visited, the Baseline file has scores realtively lesser
   than the scores in the BFS_File
2) Bunch of links in the Baseline file are visited by the teleportation technique higher up when compared to the BFS_File   
3) StrongRank, i.e the links that are relevant to the seed URL seem to appear almost in the same order as the Baseline
4) WeakRanked, i.e the files that are ranked lowest are visited in different orders by the Baseline and the BFS_File

Comparision of Baseline and DFS_File
1) Observing the files its evident that the links are by far very different
2) The PageRanks of links in the Baseline are lesser when compared to the scores in the DFS_File
3) For links that are almost similar, the pagerank of DFS_File is greater compared to the Baseline

--------------------
Task 2C - Question3
--------------------

Baseline - Baseline.txt

BFS_File - InLinksSortG1.txt
DFS_File - InLinksSortG2.txt

Pros
-----
1) The calculation of in-links counts to a particular Document is easier/faster when compared to the calculation of the Page Rank
2) Every count.in-link to page is considered a vote of support. The page is likely to be visited first than the pages without many in-links
   Links relevant to the seed URL are visited as top choices

Cons
-----
1) A page can be considered important even if there are spam links pointing to the page, without any relevant content
2) If the Document has more in-links, the algorithm considers it important but there could be other
   pages that are more important (According to PageRank calculation)
3) Page Rank takes into consideration both the damping_factor and the in_links theyby increasing the importance of the page
